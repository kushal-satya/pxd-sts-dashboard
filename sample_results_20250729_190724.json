It is specifically recommended for irrigated areas of Haryana and Punjab. A key strength is its strong resistance to all 10 presently prevalent pathotypes of Bacterial Blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) in Punjab. However, it shows susceptibility to other diseases like Neck Blast (19% incidence) and Brown Spot, and to pests such as Leaf Folder and White-backed Plant Hopper. While it is consistently listed as a check or evaluated in trials related to drought, heat, and salinity, direct evidence of high tolerance to these abiotic stresses is limited or conflicting, with some indications of lower water use efficiency compared to other varieties and susceptibility to diseases that often accompany stress. Its yield performance is good, with reported averages ranging from 73 to 83.13 q/ha, although some comparisons suggest it may be out-yielded by newer varieties like PR-122 and PR-126 in certain conditions. It has achieved significant farmer adoption, covering about 10% of the rice area in some regions, and its seeds are widely available through NSC, State Seed Corporations, and KVKs, indicating strong commercial viability and acceptance."

      "comprehensive_summary": "PR-124 (IET 22767) is a pivotal rice variety, officially notified in 2015 by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, for cultivation in irrigated regions of Haryana and Punjab. It is a semi-dwarf, early to medium-duration variety, maturing in approximately 135 days, with an average plant height of 107 cm. A standout feature is its robust resistance to all 10 currently prevalent pathotypes of Bacterial Blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) in Punjab. However, its disease profile is mixed, showing susceptibility to Neck Blast (19.0% incidence) and Brown Spot, and to insect pests such as Leaf Folder and White-backed Plant Hopper. \n\nYield performance for PR-124 is generally strong, with reported averages ranging from 73 to 83.13 q/ha in various trials, and a maximum potential of 84.5 q/ha. Despite these high yields, some comparative studies suggest that newer varieties, such as PR-122, may offer marginally higher yields or net returns under specific conditions. While PR-124 has been consistently evaluated in trials for drought, heat, and salinity tolerance, explicit, strong, quantitative evidence of high tolerance to these abiotic stresses is limited or inconclusive from the available data. Its relatively lower water use efficiency compared to PR-126 is noted. The variety was developed through the pedigree method involving a cross of PR 116, PAU 3075-3-38, and PR 106-P3.\n\nCommercially, PR-124 has achieved high farmer adoption, notably covering around 10% of the rice cultivation area in certain regions, and is recognized as a 'popular variety' in production surveys. Its seeds are readily available through official channels including the National Seeds Corporation (NSC), various State Seed Corporations (e.g., Punjab, Gujarat), and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), indicating a well-established seed production and distribution network. The overall evidence quality is high, drawing from numerous government reports, university publications, and peer-reviewed articles, all primarily post-2008, ensuring current relevance. However, detailed molecular and genetic information, such as specific QTLs or molecular markers, remains an identified gap in the provided data.",

It demonstrates good yield potential (2.0-2.5 t/ha) and a medium maturity duration of 124-131 days, contributing to its suitability in diverse cropping systems. A key strength of Pusa 12 is its reported resistance to significant biotic stresses, including Yellow Mosaic Virus, Soybean Mosaic Virus, and Bacterial Pustule, along with Rhizoctonia aerial blight. It also exhibits tolerance to lodging. In terms of abiotic stress, it shows moderate tolerance to both drought and salinity. However, detailed physiological or molecular mechanisms for these tolerances, as well as specific QTLs or genetic markers, are not extensively documented in the available information. Its development involved a rigorous multi-stage review process by the Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, which required comprehensive trial data and morphological characterization. Seed availability is facilitated through the National Seeds Corporation, and it is considered a popular variety, implying good farmer acceptance, though precise adoption rates are not quantified. Overall, Pusa 12 represents a robust soybean option for its recommended agro-climatic zone, combining moderate stress resilience with favorable agronomic traits, despite some gaps in detailed molecular characterization in the public domain.",

It was developed by Pioneer Overseas Corporation, with its institutional presence in Chikkaballapur. The variety is specifically recommended for cultivation in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. While its official release status is confirmed by government records (Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards and SeedNet Portal), comprehensive scientific details regarding its specific stress tolerance mechanisms (drought, heat, salinity, flood, submergence, disease, pest resistance), genetic characteristics (QTLs, molecular markers, gene sequences), and detailed agronomic performance metrics (yield data, maturity duration, input requirements) are not readily available in the publicly accessible scientific and government literature provided. The variety underwent a rigorous review process, including multiple committee meetings, with detailed information (such as disease/pest data, parentage, morphological characters, and trial data) explicitly requested and received prior to its final recommendation for notification. However, these detailed reports are not part of the provided search results. Therefore, while commercially available and recommended for specific regions, the scientific understanding of its stress-tolerant attributes and detailed performance is largely uncharacterized by the available data."

      "comprehensive_summary": "P-3580 (X-35A180) is a corn variety developed by Pioneer Overseas Corporation and officially approved and notified for release in India in 2015. It is recommended for cultivation in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. The variety underwent a multi-stage review process by the Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, which explicitly requested and received various detailed information, including 'All India Coordinated Trial data on disease & pest', 'Source and genesis of the parentages', and 'detailed morphological characters' before its final recommendation. Despite this rigorous regulatory pathway, the provided comprehensive search results, including Google Scholar and broad Google searches, yield no specific scientific publications or detailed reports on the variety's stress tolerance (drought, heat, salinity, flood, submergence, disease, or pest resistance), nor its underlying genetic and molecular characteristics (QTLs, markers, gene sequences, genomic data). Similarly, quantitative agronomic performance data such as specific yield figures, precise maturity duration, or detailed input requirements are not publicly available in the provided data. The term 'P-3580' frequently appears in the search results as page numbers or unrelated reference codes, rendering most external search hits irrelevant to the corn variety. Consequently, while its commercial release and recommended cultivation areas are confirmed, the technical understanding of its stress tolerance mechanisms, genetic makeup, and detailed field performance remains largely uncharacterized by the current evidence set. The reliability of information on its release status is high due to government sources, but the scientific depth concerning its actual performance and genetic traits is severely limited, resulting in a low overall evidence quality for detailed analytical requirements.",

It exhibits wide adaptability across multiple states in India including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. The variety is noted for its high resistance to major diseases such as downy mildew, leaf blast, and rust, contributing to stable performance. It possesses favorable agronomic traits including a strong stem, robust root system leading to lodging tolerance, and good grain and dry stover yields. Evidence also suggests high heat tolerance, particularly suitable for summer millet cultivation, and general drought tolerance, aligning with typical pearl millet characteristics. While specific molecular data and QTLs for stress tolerance are not detailed, its performance in coordinated trials and adoption in farmer demonstrations indicate its commercial viability and potential for improved millet production."

      "comprehensive_summary": "Pearl Millet hybrid 86M88 (MH-1816), developed by Pioneer Overseas Corporation, was officially recommended for notification in 2015 after a thorough review of submitted data, including comprehensive disease and pest information. It is recommended for cultivation in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, showcasing wide regional adaptability. The variety demonstrates high tolerance to key environmental stresses, including high heat, making it suitable for summer millet markets, and general drought tolerance, leveraging pearl millet's inherent resilience. Crucially, 86M88 exhibits strong resistance to prevalent diseases such as downy mildew, leaf blast, and rust, contributing to stable yields. Agronomically, it is a high-yielding hybrid, with reported grain yields ranging from approximately 39.5 Q/ha (16 Q/acre) to an impressive 5395 kg/ha, frequently serving as a 'best check hybrid' in trials. It reaches maturity in 86 days and is characterized by a tall plant stature, strong stem, and robust root system, imparting lodging tolerance. It has also shown responsiveness to foliar iron application, indicating good nutrient use efficiency. While specific genetic markers or QTLs for its stress tolerance are not explicitly detailed in the provided data, its superior performance is a result of targeted breeding efforts by Pioneer. Commercial availability is established, supported by its presence in government seed registries, commercial distributors, and utilization in Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) field demonstrations, signifying a positive reception among farmers. The overall evidence quality is high, drawing from government databases, institutional reports, and peer-reviewed scientific literature.",

It was officially approved for notification in 2015. This hybrid demonstrates broad adaptation, recommended for cultivation across diverse states in India including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. A critical strength of 86M01 lies in its stress tolerance, particularly noted for high drought and salinity tolerance. It also exhibits good resistance to major pearl millet diseases like downy mildew, smut, ergot, rust, and blast, and tolerance to key insect pests such as shoot fly and stem borer. Agronomically, 86M01 is characterized by high grain and fodder yield potential, is highly responsive to fertilizer application, and shows good stability across various environments. Its genetic profile is being further explored for molecular markers related to stress tolerance, indicating ongoing research and potential for marker-assisted breeding."
